# Neural Networks From Scratch

The goal of this repository is to **recreate as many types of neural networks as possible** from scratch, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks.

## 📌 Current Progress
- ✅ Implemented a **basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** capable of handling **binary classification** tasks.
- ✅ Implemented **Binary Cross Entropy** as well as **Cross Entropy** for multi class classification
- ✅ Implemented **ReLU** and **Sigmoid** activation functions
- ✅ Implemented **Mini-batches** for much faster training
- ✅ Implemented **Gradient descent with momentum**, **RMSProp** and **Adam** optimizers

## 🛠️ To Do
- [X] Implement different **cost functions**  
- [X] Add various **optimizers** (Adam, RMSprop, etc.)  
- [X] Support multiple **activation functions**
- [ ] Implement **gradient clipping**
- [X] Implement **mini-batches**
- [ ] Implement different types of **regularization** (L1, L2, Dropout)
