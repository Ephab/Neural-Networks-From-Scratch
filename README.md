# Neural Networks From Scratch

The goal of this repository is to **recreate as many types of neural networks as possible** from scratch, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks.

## 📌 Current Progress
✅ Implemented a **basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** capable of handling **binary classification** tasks.

## 🛠️ To Do
- [ ] Implement different **cost functions**  
- [ ] Add various **optimizers** (Adam, RMSprop, etc.)  
- [ ] Support multiple **activation functions**
- [ ] Implement **gradient clipping**
- [ ] Implement **mini batch**

> 🚀 This is an ongoing learning project aimed at understanding the inner workings of neural networks from the ground up.
